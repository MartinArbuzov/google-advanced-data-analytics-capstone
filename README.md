### Modeling Employee Retention using Logistic Regression

**Overview** \
The goal of this project is to analyze data provided for a hypothetical company and build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company. In the process of exploring the data, I created several visualizations to show the relationships between the different variables. The final binomial logistic regression model performed with an 82% accuracy and a 79% precision in predicting employee outcomes on a test dataset. 

**Business Understanding** \
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

**Data Understanding** \
The data on Salifort Motors came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv). The dataset contained 14,999 rows and 10 columns. The columns represented employee responses to and HR survey and included fields like employee evaluations, self-reported satisfaction scores, salary, tenure, and monthly working hours.
